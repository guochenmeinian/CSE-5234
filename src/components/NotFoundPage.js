            Hey there!
            Sorry to break it to ya, but it seems like the info you're looking for is hiding out in a parallel dimension.
            We've checked all the portals, but no luck.
            Looks like this data's off on an adventure of its own!
            Wubba lubba dub dub! ðŸš€ðŸŒ€ðŸŒŒ
        </Box>
    )
};

export default NotFoundPage;
